        <p id="intro">Introduction: A Sonic Can of Worms.</p>
        <p id="vibratoryWorms">
          In Whitehead’s opus Process and Reality, in the section on prehension, he devotes slightly more than one page to the question of the audition of sound (1978, 233-5)1. Here he slyly defines this as a ‘simple’ example that avoids any ‘unnecessary complexity’, while in fact opening a can of (vibratory) worms. Whitehead is, I think, well aware that he is opening this can, and that the example hints at the fact that to attempt to follow all the threads of the events that go to make up this particular event of audition is to embark on an unending task: to confront the ‘social effort’ of the whole universe that has gone into the event’s makeup (233). That is, the closer one begins to look at the audition of a particular note the more complex, vague and entangled it will become (the deeper the rabbit hole, to mix metaphors), and less sure we will become about the existence of any stable entity or event that might be safely called a ‘note’.
        </p>
        <p id="oneDefiniteNote">
          As Whitehead briefly examines this audition of ‘one definite note’, it becomes clear that any such audition is entirely singular (‘a particular fact not to be torn away from any of its elements’) (234) and endlessly complex. This subjective complexity is, he argues, synthesised from three patterns of contrasts: those of the datum, the ‘emotional quality’ and ‘the pattern of emotional intensity’ (ibid). In this the listener composes one complex feeling from a series of feelings that in themselves are divisible into infinitely complex datum (of which only those differentials between tone and overtones are defined by Whitehead), from their mediated relationship to all the spatial and sonic qualities of the environment in which the note sounds, and from personal ‘qualities of joy and distaste, of adversion and aversion’ (ibid). In their patterning and valuation of contrasting feelings to compose the note, the auditor grasps, though largely not in a conscious sense, a whole world or ecology of relations in-composition. Here the event of audition is not that of a passive listening to the already resolved sound, but is entirely active. This is not a resolution of difference but of sustained resonant and productive difference across many registers whose intensity is held in the beauty, if not always the harmony, of the definite note.
        </p>
        <p id="proposal">
        I want to propose that the act of listening or audition is an autonomous act of composition not reception (and thus not inexorably linked to hermeneutics as Barthes claims (249)), and in this it does not preserve or archive the sound event, but instead anarchives the one simple note. That is, if we might think of the act of ‘archiving’ as one of collecting and preserving the already-formed, so that it might be represented or repeated, in ‘anarchiving’ we might instead take existent material or events and reinvigorate (rather than re-live) them through acts of re-composition that take this data and incorporate them into new events. Or, rather, anarchiving immediates in resonance with the event.
